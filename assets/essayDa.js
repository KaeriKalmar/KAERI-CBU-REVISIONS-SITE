        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The illuminator, typically a bulb in the base, provides the light that is the foundation of the image formation process."
      },
      {
        q: "What is the role of the condenser lens system in a brightfield microscope?",
        options: [
          "To bend light rays to form a magnified image.",

        ],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "The opaque central stop in the darkfield condenser is essential, as it blocks the direct path of light to the objective lens."
      },
      {
        q: "How does the light illuminate the specimen in darkfield microscopy?",
        options: [
          "Light is transmitted directly through the specimen.",

        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The light is prevented from reaching the specimen head-on and is instead passed around it from the sides."
      },
      {
        q: "What happens to the light that hits the specimen in a darkfield microscope?",
        options: [
          "It is all absorbed by the specimen.",
          "It passes straight through the specimen to the objective lens.",
          "It is scattered or refracted by the specimen's structures.",
          "It is reflected away from the objective lens."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The light interacts with the specimen's structures, causing it to be scattered and redirected. This scattered light is what creates the image."

          "It is mottled and blurry."
        ],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "The background is dark because the light that did not interact with the specimen is blocked from entering the objective lens."
      },
      {
        q: "For what type of specimens is darkfield microscopy particularly useful?",
        options: [
          "Thick tissue sections stained with dyes.",

        q: "What is a major limitation of TEM that is shared with SEM?",
        options: [
          "It can only be used on living specimens.",
          "It is very inexpensive and widely available.",
          "It requires the specimen to be in a vacuum, so it cannot be used on living cells.",
          "It has lower resolution than a light microscope."
        ],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "The electron beam requires a vacuum to travel without scattering. This means that both TEM and SEM are limited to non-living specimens."

        "Crossing over occurs; homologous chromosomes separate."
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: "In Telophase, the separated chromosomes reach the poles, begin to decondense, and new nuclear envelopes form around each set of chromosomes, forming two new nuclei. Cytokinesis, which usually overlaps with telophase, is the division of the cytoplasm, resulting in two separate, genetically identical daughter cells. The importance of mitosis lies in its role in growth, tissue repair, development, and asexual reproduction, maintaining a constant chromosome number and genetic integrity."
