    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Hardware refers to the tangible, physical parts of a computer that you can touch, including components like the case, wires, circuits, memory chips, and the CPU. Software (A and D) is intangible, and cloud data (C) is stored remotely. Hardware is distinct from software, which provides instructions to the hardware."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Multi-core processors can execute multiple instructions at the same time by dividing work among cores, similar to having multiple workers instead of one. This parallel processing improves performance, especially for multitasking and demanding applications. Physical size (A), power consumption (C), and heat generation (D) are not inherent performance advantages of more cores."

      "To temporarily hold data and programs while they are being actively processed by the CPU",
      "To display images on the monitor"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Computer memory (RAM) serves as a high-speed temporary workspace, holding data and instructions that the CPU needs immediately. Permanent storage (A) is the role of hard drives or SSDs. Internet connection (C) is networking, and display (D) is the monitor's function."

    "options": [
      "Less RAM is needed because applications share memory",

      "RAM requirements remain unchanged regardless of application count",
      "The computer uses virtual memory instead, eliminating RAM needs"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Each running application occupies space in RAM. Running more applications simultaneously increases the total data that must be held in memory, raising RAM requirements. When RAM is insufficient, the system uses slower virtual memory (hard drive space), which degrades performance."

      "A temporary internet file that speeds up web browsing"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "When RAM becomes full, the operating system uses a portion of the hard drive as virtual memory, called a swap file or paging file, to temporarily store excess data. This prevents system crashes but slows performance because hard drives are much slower than RAM."

      "It doubles the effective processing speed of the CPU",
      "It may decrease computer performance because hard drives are slower than RAM"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Virtual memory uses the hard drive as overflow space when RAM is full. Hard drives (even SSDs) are substantially slower than RAM, so when the system must constantly swap data between RAM and the swap file, performance degrades noticeably due to the speed mismatch."

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "RAM (Random Access Memory) consists of memory chips plugged into slots on the motherboard. It is temporary (holds data only while power is on) and volatile (loses contents when power is off). It is not permanent storage (A), cloud-based (C), or external USB storage (D)."

      "It changes color based on the data stored",
      "It requires constant voltage fluctuation to function"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Volatile memory requires continuous power to maintain stored data. When you shut down or lose power, everything in RAM is immediately erased. This is why unsaved work is lost during a power outage. Non-volatile memory (like ROM or hard drives) retains data without power."

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Firmware is software stored in non-volatile memory (like ROM) that provides low-level control for hardware. It is \"firm\" because it resides in hardware but can still be updated through special procedures (firmware updates). It is not damaged software (A), a virus (C), or physical wiring (D)."

      "Memory that never needs refreshing and retains data permanently",
      "Memory that uses magnetic charges for storage",
      "Memory that is permanently installed in the CPU"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "DRAM must be refreshed thousands of times per second to retain data because its storage cells leak charge. This constant refreshing requirement is why it's called \"dynamic.\" It is volatile, so data is lost without power. It is not non-volatile (A), magnetic (C), or CPU-resident (D)."

      "Cannot retain data even with power applied",
      "Slower and requires more frequent refreshing than DRAM"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "SRAM is faster and more reliable than DRAM because it doesn't need constant refreshing. However, it's more complex and expensive to manufacture, so it's used in smaller quantities like CPU cache rather than main system memory. It does not use magnetic storage (C) and does retain data with power (D is false)."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "MRAM uses magnetic states (rather than electrical charges) to store data. This magnetic storage method gives it the speed of RAM while being non-volatile---it retains data even without power. It does not require refreshing (A), burning (C), or lasers (D)."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Storage (like hard drives) is long-term and nonvolatile---it retains data even when power is off. Memory (RAM) is temporary and volatile---it holds data only while the computer is running and loses everything when power is turned off. Storage is like a file cabinet for permanent keeping, while memory is like a desk workspace for active tasks."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Multiple platters increase storage capacity by providing more surface area for data storage. Each platter has two sides that can store data, and more platters mean more data can be stored in the same physical space. All platters rotate together on a single spindle."

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The platters spin at high speed, creating a cushion of air that floats the read/write heads just nanometers above the surface. This air bearing prevents physical contact, which would cause friction, wear, and potentially a destructive head crash."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Two-factor authentication requires two different forms of verification, typically something you know (password) and something you have (phone, security key).

    ],
    "correct": 0,

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "NFC's very short operating range (a few centimeters) is actually a security feature---an attacker would need to be physically very close to intercept the signal. This makes remote eavesdropping much harder than with longer-range wireless technologies."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "RAM uses electronic circuits (like capacitors in DRAM) that require constant power and refreshing to maintain data. Storage uses different technologies---magnetic orientation (HDDs) or trapped electrons in flash memory (SSDs)---that persist without power. The trade-off is that RAM is much faster."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Unsaved work exists only in volatile RAM, which loses all data when power is removed. This is why you must save frequently---saving transfers data from volatile RAM to nonvolatile storage where it persists. Auto-save features help, but they work by periodically saving to storage."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "As platters spin at high speed (thousands of RPM), they drag air along due to viscosity. This creates a thin, high-pressure air bearing between the platter surface and the read/write head, floating the head just nanometers above the surface. This prevents destructive physical contact."
