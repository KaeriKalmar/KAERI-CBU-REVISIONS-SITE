      "back": "They are credited with discovering the first simple microscope by experimenting with lenses in a tube in the late 16th century, laying the groundwork for compound microscopes.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Their work with lenses in a tube was a foundational step in the development of optical instruments for magnification."

    },

    {

      "front": "How do a simple light microscope and a compound light microscope differ?",

      "back": "A simple light microscope uses a single lens and offers low magnification. A compound light microscope uses multiple lenses (an objective lens and an eyepiece) in combination to achieve much higher magnification.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "The combination of lenses in a compound microscope allows for sequential magnification, greatly increasing the total magnification possible."

    },

    {

      "front": "Describe the principle of a light microscope, focusing on how lenses bend light and the concept of refraction.",

      "back": "A light microscope works on the principle of refraction, where light rays from an illuminator pass through lenses. These lenses bend (refract) the light, causing it to converge to a focal point, thereby magnifying the image of the specimen.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another (e.g., from air to glass in a lens), which is the basis for image formation and magnification."

    },

    {

      "front": "Define 'focal point' and 'focal length' in microscopy. How does focal length relate to lens strength?",

      "back": "The 'focal point' is the point where parallel light rays converge after passing through a lens. 'Focal length' is the distance from the center of the lens to its focal point. A shorter focal length indicates a stronger lens and thus higher magnification.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Lenses with shorter focal lengths bring light to a sharper, closer focus, resulting in greater enlargement of the image."

    {

      "front": "What is the Abbe equation, and what does it help calculate in microscopy?",

      "back": "The Abbe equation (d = 0.5λ / NA) relates the minimum resolvable distance (d) to the wavelength of light (λ) and the numerical aperture (NA) of the lens. It helps calculate the theoretical limit of resolution for a microscope.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "This equation is fundamental to understanding the resolving power of a microscope – its ability to distinguish two closely spaced objects as separate."

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "These advanced light microscopy techniques offer different ways to enhance contrast and visualize specific features, often without staining, or to create 3D images."

    },

    {

      "front": "Identify and briefly describe three major parts of a bright-field microscope.",

      "back": "Three major parts include: the **illuminator** (light source), the **condenser** (focuses light onto the specimen), the **stage** (where the specimen slide is placed), **objective lenses** (magnify the specimen), and the **eyepiece/ocular lens** (magnifies the image from the objectives). (Any three are acceptable)",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Each component plays a crucial role in directing light, magnifying the image, and allowing for specimen manipulation."

    },

    {

      "front": "Explain how an aperture diaphragm controls contrast in a bright-field microscope.",

      "back": "The aperture diaphragm controls the amount of light passing through the specimen. Closing it down increases contrast by reducing scattered light, but can also reduce resolution. Opening it increases resolution but lowers contrast.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Balancing contrast and resolution by adjusting the aperture diaphragm is a key skill in bright-field microscopy."

      "back": "Two applications include viewing stained plant and animal cell organelles and observing the morphology and arrangement of stained bacterial cells.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Its simplicity and ability to view stained samples make it widely used in educational and clinical settings."

    },

    {

      "front": "What unique characteristic of the Phase Contrast Microscope allows it to view unstained cells, and why is this significant?",

      "back": "It converts subtle differences in the refractive index and thickness within unstained cells (phase shifts) into observable differences in brightness and contrast. This is significant because it allows observation of living, unstained cells and their internal structures without killing or distorting them with stains.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Being able to observe living processes in real-time is a major advantage of phase contrast microscopy."

      "back": "Five parts include: Light Source, Condenser with Annular Ring, Specimen Stage, Objective Lens with Phase Plate, Eyepiece, Focus Knobs, Mechanical Stage.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "The annular ring and phase plate are the key components that differentiate it from a standard bright-field microscope."

    },

    {

      "front": "Describe the appearance of a specimen and its surrounding field when viewed under a Dark-Field Light Microscope.",

      "back": "Under a Dark-Field Light Microscope, the specimen appears brightly illuminated (often white or light-colored) against a completely dark or black background. This occurs because only scattered light from the specimen enters the objective lens.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "This technique is particularly useful for visualizing unstained, transparent, or very thin specimens, such as spirochetes."

    },

    {

      "front": "How does Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM) reconstruct a complete image?",

      "back": "CSLM uses a laser to scan the specimen point by point and line by line. Emitted fluorescent light from each scanned point is detected, and a computer then reconstructs these signals into a sharp, clear image, often in 3D, by assembling images from different focal planes.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "The scanning and computational reconstruction allow CSLM to create optical sections, eliminating out-of-focus blur and enabling 3D rendering."

      "front": "What are the main events of Telophase and Cytokinesis?",
      "back": "In Telophase, the separated chromosomes arrive at the poles and begin to uncoil. New nuclear membranes form around the two sets of chromosomes, and the spindle apparatus disassembles. Cytokinesis, the division of the cytoplasm, typically overlaps with Telophase, resulting in two distinct daughter cells.",
      "course": "BI110",
      "term": "T1",
      "explanation": "Telophase reverses the events of prophase, and cytokinesis physically separates the two nascent cells."
