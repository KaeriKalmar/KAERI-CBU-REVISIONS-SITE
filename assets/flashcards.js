 "MICROSCOPY & STAINING": [

    {

      "front": "What was the contribution of Zaccharias and Hans Janssen to microscopy?",

      "back": "They are credited with discovering the first simple microscope by experimenting with lenses in a tube in the late 16th century, laying the groundwork for compound microscopes.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Their work with lenses in a tube was a foundational step in the development of optical instruments for magnification."

    },

    {

      "front": "How do a simple light microscope and a compound light microscope differ?",

      "back": "A simple light microscope uses a single lens and offers low magnification. A compound light microscope uses multiple lenses (an objective lens and an eyepiece) in combination to achieve much higher magnification.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "The combination of lenses in a compound microscope allows for sequential magnification, greatly increasing the total magnification possible."

    },

    {

      "front": "Describe the principle of a light microscope, focusing on how lenses bend light and the concept of refraction.",

      "back": "A light microscope works on the principle of refraction, where light rays from an illuminator pass through lenses. These lenses bend (refract) the light, causing it to converge to a focal point, thereby magnifying the image of the specimen.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another (e.g., from air to glass in a lens), which is the basis for image formation and magnification."

    },

    {

      "front": "Define 'focal point' and 'focal length' in microscopy. How does focal length relate to lens strength?",

      "back": "The 'focal point' is the point where parallel light rays converge after passing through a lens. 'Focal length' is the distance from the center of the lens to its focal point. A shorter focal length indicates a stronger lens and thus higher magnification.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Lenses with shorter focal lengths bring light to a sharper, closer focus, resulting in greater enlargement of the image."

    },

    {

      "front": "What is the Abbe equation, and what does it help calculate in microscopy?",

      "back": "The Abbe equation (d = 0.5λ / NA) relates the minimum resolvable distance (d) to the wavelength of light (λ) and the numerical aperture (NA) of the lens. It helps calculate the theoretical limit of resolution for a microscope.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "This equation is fundamental to understanding the resolving power of a microscope – its ability to distinguish two closely spaced objects as separate."

    },

    {

      "front": "List four modern types of light microscopes.",

      "back": "Phase Contrast Light Microscope, Dark-Field Light Microscope, Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (CSLM), and Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) Microscope.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "These advanced light microscopy techniques offer different ways to enhance contrast and visualize specific features, often without staining, or to create 3D images."

    },

    {

      "front": "Identify and briefly describe three major parts of a bright-field microscope.",

      "back": "Three major parts include: the **illuminator** (light source), the **condenser** (focuses light onto the specimen), the **stage** (where the specimen slide is placed), **objective lenses** (magnify the specimen), and the **eyepiece/ocular lens** (magnifies the image from the objectives). (Any three are acceptable)",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Each component plays a crucial role in directing light, magnifying the image, and allowing for specimen manipulation."

    },

    {

      "front": "Explain how an aperture diaphragm controls contrast in a bright-field microscope.",

      "back": "The aperture diaphragm controls the amount of light passing through the specimen. Closing it down increases contrast by reducing scattered light, but can also reduce resolution. Opening it increases resolution but lowers contrast.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Balancing contrast and resolution by adjusting the aperture diaphragm is a key skill in bright-field microscopy."

    },

    {

      "front": "State two applications of the Bright Field Light Microscope.",

      "back": "Two applications include viewing stained plant and animal cell organelles and observing the morphology and arrangement of stained bacterial cells.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Its simplicity and ability to view stained samples make it widely used in educational and clinical settings."

    },

    {

      "front": "What unique characteristic of the Phase Contrast Microscope allows it to view unstained cells, and why is this significant?",

      "back": "It converts subtle differences in the refractive index and thickness within unstained cells (phase shifts) into observable differences in brightness and contrast. This is significant because it allows observation of living, unstained cells and their internal structures without killing or distorting them with stains.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Being able to observe living processes in real-time is a major advantage of phase contrast microscopy."

    },

    {

      "front": "List at least five parts that make up the Phase Contrast Microscope's instrumentation.",

      "back": "Five parts include: Light Source, Condenser with Annular Ring, Specimen Stage, Objective Lens with Phase Plate, Eyepiece, Focus Knobs, Mechanical Stage.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "The annular ring and phase plate are the key components that differentiate it from a standard bright-field microscope."

    },

    {

      "front": "Describe the appearance of a specimen and its surrounding field when viewed under a Dark-Field Light Microscope.",

      "back": "Under a Dark-Field Light Microscope, the specimen appears brightly illuminated (often white or light-colored) against a completely dark or black background. This occurs because only scattered light from the specimen enters the objective lens.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "This technique is particularly useful for visualizing unstained, transparent, or very thin specimens, such as spirochetes."

    },

    {

      "front": "How does Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy (CSLM) reconstruct a complete image?",

      "back": "CSLM uses a laser to scan the specimen point by point and line by line. Emitted fluorescent light from each scanned point is detected, and a computer then reconstructs these signals into a sharp, clear image, often in 3D, by assembling images from different focal planes.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "The scanning and computational reconstruction allow CSLM to create optical sections, eliminating out-of-focus blur and enabling 3D rendering."

    },

    {

      "front": "Explain the role of the polariser and objective-specific prism in the working mechanism of Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy.",

      "back": "The polariser generates linearly polarized light. This light then passes through a prism (often a Nomarski prism or Wollaston prism) that splits it into two distinct, linearly polarized rays that vibrate perpendicular to each other.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "These polarized light rays are then used to detect small differences in refractive index and thickness within the specimen."

    },

    {

      "front": "What happens when the two split beams combine in DIC microscopy after passing through the specimen and a second prism?",

      "back": "After passing through the specimen (where phase shifts occur due to variations in refractive index and thickness) and a second prism, the two split beams recombine. The interference between these two beams generates an image with differences in intensity and color, creating a pseudo-3D or 'shadow-cast' effect.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "The pseudo-3D effect of DIC provides excellent visualization of surface details and intracellular organelles in unstained, living specimens."

    },

    {

      "front": "How does a Fluorescent Microscope differ from other light microscopes in terms of how the image is produced?",

      "back": "Unlike brightfield or phase contrast microscopes that use transmitted light, a fluorescent microscope illuminates the specimen with specific wavelengths of light. This causes fluorescent molecules (fluorochromes) within the specimen to absorb the light and then re-emit it at a longer wavelength, which is then captured to form the image.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Fluorescence microscopy allows for specific labeling and visualization of molecules, structures, or processes within cells."

    },

    {

      "front": "Briefly explain the function of the barrier filter in a fluorescent microscope.",

      "back": "The barrier filter (or emission filter) is placed after the specimen and the objective lens. Its function is to block the excitation light (which would otherwise overwhelm the image) and only allow the longer-wavelength fluorescent light emitted by the specimen to pass through to the eyepiece or detector.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "This filter ensures that only the emitted light from the fluorochromes is seen, resulting in a clear fluorescent image against a dark background."

    },

    {

      "front": "Name two applications of the Fluorescent Microscope.",

      "back": "Two applications include detecting specific molecules or structures within cells using fluorescent labels (e.g., immunofluorescence to detect antigens/antibodies) and visualizing living cells tagged with fluorescent proteins.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "Immunofluorescence is a powerful technique for localizing proteins and other molecules in cells and tissues."

    },

    {

      "front": "What are two fundamental differences between electron microscopy and light microscopy, particularly concerning resolution and specimen use?",

      "back": "Electron microscopy uses electron beams for imaging, offering significantly higher resolution and magnification than light microscopy due to the shorter wavelength of electrons. However, electron microscopy requires specimens to be dead and prepared in a vacuum, whereas light microscopy can often image living specimens.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "The trade-off for higher resolution in EM is the inability to view living samples and the complex sample preparation."

    },

    {

      "front": "Differentiate between Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) based on their basic function.",

      "back": "TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope) is used to observe the internal structures of very thin specimens, as electrons pass *through* the sample. SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) is used to visualize the detailed surface topography of specimens by scanning an electron beam *across* the surface and detecting secondary electrons.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "term": "T1",

      "explanation": "TEM provides 2D internal views, while SEM provides 3D surface views."

  "CELL STRUCTURE & FUNCTIONS": [

    {

      "front": "What is the cell theory and what are its three main postulates?",

      "back": "The cell theory states that the cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all known living organisms, all living organisms are composed of one or more cells, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells by division.",

      "front": "Differentiate between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, providing at least three key differences.",

      "back": "Prokaryotic cells lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, typically have a circular DNA in the cytoplasm, and are generally smaller. Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus, membrane-bound organelles, linear DNA within the nucleus, and are generally larger.",

      "course": "BI110",

      "front": "What is the 'powerhouse of the cell' and why is it given this name? Include a brief description of its structure.",

      "back": "The Mitochondria are known as the 'powerhouse of the cell' because they are responsible for generating most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy, through cellular respiration. They are small, rod-shaped organelles bounded by two membranes – an outer and a highly folded inner membrane (cristae).",

      "course": "BI110",
