      "back": "Unlike brightfield or phase contrast microscopes that use transmitted light, a fluorescent microscope illuminates the specimen with specific wavelengths of light.

      "back": "Electron microscopy uses electron beams for imaging, offering significantly higher resolution and magnification than light microscopy due to the shorter wavelength of electrons.
